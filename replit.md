# Pugmill CMS

## AGENT SETUP PROTOCOL — FOLLOW THIS BEFORE STARTING THE APP

When the init script runs it will print a banner listing required actions.
**After the app starts, pause and complete all items in that banner before
telling the user setup is done.** Specifically:

1. Call `requestEnvVar` with `requestType: "secret"` and `keys: ["NEXTAUTH_SECRET"]`.
   The value is printed in the startup banner. If it did not appear, run
   `grep NEXTAUTH_SECRET .env.local` to retrieve it. If `.env.local` is missing,
   generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
   Do NOT mention the value in chat — use the secrets tool so the user sees a
   confirmation dialog they must interact with.
2. Call `requestEnvVar` with `requestType: "secret"` and
   `keys: ["AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY"]`. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. This
   key encrypts the AI provider API key and the AEO network token at rest in
   the database. Without it, both are stored as plaintext (the app warns but
   continues to work). Setting it now means rotating the key later doesn't
   silently break decryption of previously-saved values.
3. Call `requestEnvVar` with `requestType: "secret"` and
   `keys: ["CRON_SECRET"]`. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. This is
   the bearer token both `/api/cron/publish-scheduled` and
   `/api/cron/report-network` check before doing any work — without it,
   every cron call returns 401 silently and scheduled posts never publish,
   network reports never reach aeopugmill.com.
4. Immediately after, call `requestEnvVar` with `requestType: "secret"` and
   `keys: ["PRODUCTION_URL"]`. Do this **even if PRODUCTION_URL is already set** —
   it may have carried over from a previous project and the user must confirm the
   value is correct for this deployment. The production URL is found in Replit's
   deployment panel (e.g. `https://yourapp.replit.app`).
   Do NOT skip. Do NOT mention it in chat. Use the secrets tool.
5. Call `requestEnvVar` with `requestType: "secret"` and
   `keys: ["NEXTAUTH_URL"]`. Use the **same value** the user just gave for
   `PRODUCTION_URL`. Replit Secrets are injected into every process
   unconditionally, while `.env.local` writes can fail silently — setting
   `NEXTAUTH_URL` directly is the belt-and-suspenders guarantee that
   authentication works on first deploy.
6. Only after all five secrets are saved via `requestEnvVar`, tell the user:
   - Click **Deploy** first (dev and production use separate databases)
   - After deploying, visit **/setup** on their **production URL** to create the admin account
   - Do NOT tell them to visit /setup on the dev URL — that account will not exist in production

Do not skip step 4. Even if PRODUCTION_URL appears to be set, always confirm it —
a stale value from a previous project will break authentication silently in production.

A self-hosted, Next.js-based CMS with admin panel, plugin system, and theme support.

## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Replit's built-in database (Drizzle ORM)
- **Auth**: NextAuth v5 (credentials + optional GitHub/Google OAuth)
- **Storage**: Local (`public/uploads/`) or S3-compatible
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Package manager**: npm

## Running the App

The app starts automatically via the "Start application" workflow (`npm run dev`).

- Port: **5000**
- On first run, visit **`/setup`** to create your admin account
- On subsequent runs, visit **`/admin/login`**

On first run, `scripts/replit-init.ts` automatically:
- Generates `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (saved to `.env.local`)
- Detects and sets `NEXTAUTH_URL` from the Replit dev domain
- Creates all database tables (idempotent)
- Runs pending migrations
- Verifies `public/uploads/` is writable for image uploads

## Environment Variables

### Auto-provisioned by Replit
- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string (Replit database integration)

### Auto-generated on first run (saved to `.env.local`)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` — also save as a Replit secret for deployment persistence
- `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — encrypts AI provider keys at rest
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` — detected from `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN`

### Optional secrets
- `PRODUCTION_URL` — custom domain override for production deployments
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` — GitHub OAuth login
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — Google OAuth login
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3` + S3 credentials — for persistent media on ephemeral hosts

## First-Time Setup

1. Start the app — the init script runs automatically
2. The init log will display a banner with **2 required actions**. Do both before deploying:
   - Save `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` as a Replit secret (read value from `.env.local`)
   - Save `PRODUCTION_URL` as a Replit secret — e.g. `https://yourapp.replit.app` (found in Replit's deployment panel)
3. Click **Deploy**
4. After deploying, visit **`/setup`** on your **production URL** to create your admin account
5. **Important**: dev and production containers have separate databases — do not create your admin account in the dev preview, it will not carry over to production

## Deployment

**During initial setup — while you are already asking the user to save NEXTAUTH_SECRET —
also ask them for their production URL and save it as a secret before they click Deploy.**

This is the right moment: the user is present, you have their attention, and the secret
needs to be in place before the production container boots for the first time.

Why this matters: `replit-init.ts` reads `PRODUCTION_URL` at first boot to set `NEXTAUTH_URL`
in the prod container. If it is missing, the script attempts auto-detection from Replit env
vars — but Replit's current UUID-based domain format (`*.riker.replit.dev`) may not be
detected correctly, leaving `NEXTAUTH_URL` wrong. When `NEXTAUTH_URL` is wrong, login
redirects and OAuth callbacks fail and the site is unusable.

What to ask the user:
> "Before you hit Deploy, I need one more thing: your production URL. You can find it in
> Replit's deployment panel or domain settings — it will look like
> `https://yourapp.replit.app` or a custom domain. I'll save it as a secret now so login
> works correctly on first boot."

Then save: `PRODUCTION_URL=https://their-url`

After deployment, check the init log for:
`Production URL: https://... (PRODUCTION_URL secret)` — confirms it was picked up correctly.

## Database Scripts

```bash
npm run db:create     # Recreate schema (IF NOT EXISTS — safe)
npm run db:migrate    # Run pending migrations
npm run db:studio     # Open Drizzle Studio
npm run replit:init   # Force re-run first-run setup
```

## Architecture Notes

- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `src/lib/` — shared server utilities (db, auth, storage, config)
- `plugins/` — built-in CMS plugins (contact form, widgets, bot analytics)
- `themes/` — theme definitions (default theme included)
- `scripts/` — setup, migration, and utility scripts
- `tests/` — Vitest unit tests (`npm test`)

## Important

- Admin accounts are created exclusively through the `/setup` wizard — there are no env vars for pre-seeding credentials
- The `/setup` route is gated: it redirects to `/admin/login` once an admin account exists
- Dev and production containers have separate databases — complete setup in **production**, not dev
- **Do not create any database files** — the database layer is complete at `src/lib/db/`. Do not scaffold `server/db.ts` or any file importing `@shared/schema`. That path alias does not exist in this project.
- **Do not modify `tsconfig.json`** — the only path alias is `@/` mapping to `./src/`. Do not add `@shared/` or any other alias.
